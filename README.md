# SpriggitDemo
A tool to facilitate converting Bethesda plugin files to a text based format that can be stored in Git.   Large scale projects can then live in Github, and accept Pull Requests from many developers.

The goal is to help modders store their files in a versioning system that allows them to easily iterate in the same way that programmers do with their code.
